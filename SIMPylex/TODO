there are a few modifications suggested and few TODOs needed to SIMPylex:

	1. Break SIMPylex into modular subparts and using CPickle, print SymbolTable and output of the lexical analyser.
	2. SymbolTable needs to be improved.
	3. Thorough testing of the algorithm implementation is due.
	4. Modify output of lexical analyser to be of the form:
		line_no.
		token1
		token2
		.
		.
		'\n'
		line_no.
		tokeni
		tokenj
		.
		.
		.
