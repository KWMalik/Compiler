# Conventions:
# each entity has to be separated by a space
# the file should end in a blank line
# any line beginning with "#" would be ignored
# all heads are treated as non-terminals, so better is to begin them with a capital letter
# all tokens in tails beginning with a small letter are treated as terminals, the rest treated as non-terminals
