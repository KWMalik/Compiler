# Conventions:
# each entity has to be separated by a space
# the file should end in a blank line
# any line beginning with "#" would be ignored
# all heads are treated as non-terminals, so better is to begin them with a capital letter
# all tokens in tails beginning with a small letter are treated as terminals, the rest treated as non-terminals
#
# Grammar:
# Successful :-
#   Same as S --> A a B b | B b A a ; A --> % ; B --> %
# Slight modification of case 2 (which leads to reduce reduce conflict)
S --> A id B + | B + A id
A --> %
B --> %
