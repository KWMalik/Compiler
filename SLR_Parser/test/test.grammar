# Conventions:
# each entity has to be separated by a space
# the file should end in a blank line
# any line beginning with "#" would be ignored
# all heads are treated as non-terminals, so better is to begin them with a capital letter
# all tokens in tails beginning with a small letter are treated as terminals, the rest treated as non-terminals
#
# Grammar:
#E --> E + T | T
#T --> T * F | F
#F --> ( E ) | id
S --> L = R | R
L --> * R | id
R --> L
#E --> T F
#F --> ( E ) | id
#T --> F
#F --> B + id
#B --> id
