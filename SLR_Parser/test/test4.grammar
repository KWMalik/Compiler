# Conventions:
# each entity has to be separated by a space
# the file should end in a blank line
# any line beginning with "#" would be ignored
# all heads are treated as non-terminals, so better is to begin them with a capital letter
# all tokens in tails beginning with a small letter are treated as terminals, the rest treated as non-terminals
#
# Grammar:
Stmts --> Stmts Stmt ; | Stmt ;
Stmt --> E Op F | E
F --> E Op F | E | ( F )
E --> id | const_int 
Op --> + | - | * | =
