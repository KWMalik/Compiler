# Conventions:
# each entity has to be separated by a space
# the file should end in a blank line
# any line beginning with "#" would be ignored
# all heads are treated as non-terminals, so better is to begin them with a capital letter
# all tokens in tails beginning with a small letter are treated as terminals, the rest treated as non-terminals
#
# Grammar:
# S --> S ; A | A ;
# A --> B C B
# B --> id
# C --> + | - | *
S --> if E then S | if E then S else S | A 
A --> a
E --> b
